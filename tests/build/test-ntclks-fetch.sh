# Contract tests for the kernel-fetch delegation: `make fetch` in the parent
# also runs `make fetch` in the ReliefNT checkout named by RELIEFNT_DIR.
#
#   1. `make reliefnt-fetch` delegates to the checkout's own fetch;
#   2. `make fetch` runs the parent fetch and the kernel fetch together;
#   3. a missing checkout warns and keeps the goal successful (fetch must keep
#      working on a fresh machine before the submodule exists);
#   4. `make -n` never reaches the sub-make (the adapter's no-output promise);
#   5. RELIEFNT_DIR pointing back at this repository skips the delegation
#      instead of recursing into `make -C . fetch`.
#
# Everything is stubbed: a fake checkout Makefile records the fetch call and
# the parent fetch script is replaced with a recorder, so no network and no
# real cache is touched.
