#   2. a UAPI content change must reinstall the export and recompile its

#   3. headers_install must not churn mtimes when nothing changed (otherwise
#      every build would silently rebuild all of userland);
#   4. the probe markers must leave the shared checkout byte-for-byte as they
#      were (a leaked marker dirties the tree for every later test).
