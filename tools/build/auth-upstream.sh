# Stage the autoconf-driven parts of the authentication chain.
#
# Linux-PAM 1.7.x is Meson-only upstream, and the ruling for this project is that
# the build may not use Meson or Ninja; PAM therefore needs a hand-written
# Makefile port and is deliberately *not* built here. Everything that still ships
# a POSIX `configure` can be built the way plan section 9 allows, and that is
# exactly the split this script makes:
#
#   linux-headers -> `make headers_install` (upstream's own Makefile)
#   libxcrypt     -> configure, make, make install DESTDIR
#
# libcrypt.so.2 and crypt.h are what the runtime DSO links and what
# userland/auth/*.c includes, so staging them here is the first honest step of
# that chain rather than a workaround: nothing about libpam is claimed.
#
# Pinned versions, digests and license paths come from the lock file, never from
# this script, so the two cannot drift apart.
